```{r setup, include=FALSE}
options(htmltools.dir.version = FALSE)
```

```{r xaringan-themer, include=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(xaringanthemer)
style_duo_accent(
  primary_color = "#1381B0",
  secondary_color = "#FF961C",
  inverse_header_color = "#FFFFFF"
)
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)
```

## Demonstration Goals

- Connect to a remote relational database using R library packages
- Leverage dplyr verbs to query a relational database
- Expose some advance query and visualization features
- Highlight useful documentation / resources 


This is not an RDBMS class.  The foundations of database administration and database engineering require more time that we have. This is a demonstration on leveraging the Tidyverse.

##  Flat file

A database within in a single table

```{r echo=FALSE}
mtcars %>% 
  slice_head(n = 10) %>% 
  gt()
```


---
## Relational databases  

A database with associated entities (tables)

## Flat file v Relational database

Flat | Relational
---  | ---
Best for a single user | Multi-user
Local disk             | Cloud storage 
Simple queries         | Advanced queries
Data is static         | Data is dynamic / changes often
Small to medium data   | Medium to large dataset 
Simple format          | Complex structure


---
## Complexities & Nuances

- Many good reasons to keep your data as a flat file  
- Several good reasons to pursue more complex data structures and deliveries
- Querying, using, and maintaining databases can be computationally and financially expensive

We're not going to discuss those complexities.  We're going to demonstrate how you can use your RStudio environment to query remote relational databases.

## SQL

Structured Query Language

```sql

SELECT 
  bdate, address
FROM
  EMPLOYEE
WHERE 
  fname = "John" AND 
  minit = "R" AND
  lname = "Little"

```

---
## dplyr


```r
employee %>% 
  filter(fname == "John", 
         minit == "R",
         lname == "Little") %>% 
  select(bdate, address)
```

```r
left_join()
```
